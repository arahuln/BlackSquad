# Project Overview:
The Campus Social Hub is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to revolutionize communication and collaboration within educational institutions. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this platform serves as a centralized hub exclusively for campus members, including students, professors, and administrative staff.

 # Key Features:

1. User Authentication and Roles: A robust authentication system that allows users to register and log in with different roles—students, professors, and administration—each with tailored permissions.

2. Content Sharing: Users can seamlessly post images and tweets within the platform, promoting information sharing and engagement. A retweet feature facilitates the dissemination of relevant content.

3.Automated Content Moderation: Leveraging various NLP APIs, the platform filters spam, profanity, toxicity, and harassment in user-generated content, ensuring adherence to community guidelines.

4.Context-based Authentication: Enhancing security, the platform employs context-based authentication to ensure users access only relevant information based on their roles and permissions.

5. Groups: Creation and joining of groups based on shared interests, courses, or extracurricular activities, facilitating discussions and collaboration.

6. Problem Sharing and Resolution: A dedicated space for users to share campus-related problems or concerns. The administration can monitor discussions, identify pressing issues, and take appropriate actions.

Additional Features:

Trending Topics: Identification of trending topics and discussions based on user engagement and activity, encouraging participation and awareness.

Chat and Inbox:Real-time chat functionality for one-on-one communication between users. An inbox feature enables the management of private messages within the platform.

Expected Impact:

The Campus Social Hub aims to promote transparency, foster community, and empower users to collectively address campus-wide issues. By providing a centralized platform for communication and collaboration, it has the potential to become an indispensable tool within educational institutions.

# Deliverables:

- Fully functional web application developed using the MERN stack.
- User documentation and guides for seamless onboarding and usage.
- Implementation of key features outlined in the project overview.

- Deployment of the application on a suitable hosting platform for campus-wide access.

# Conclusion:

Through the effective implementation and adoption of modern web technologies and user-centric design principles, the Campus Social Hub project aims to revolutionize campus communication and problem-solving. It endeavors to foster collaboration, community engagement, and positive change within educational institutions.
